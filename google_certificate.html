						<b>The Problem</b>
                        
                        Planning a trip can be time-consuming, overwhelming, and expensive‚Äîespecially for students or financially
                        conscious users. Many people lack the time, tools, or travel knowledge to plan an affordable and enjoyable trip.
                        Others want to travel but don't have companions or can't afford to go solo.

                        <!-- (Why did you create this project? Explain the problem and goal that you set out to solve with your product. Be sure to include the target audience as well as a brief explanation of their pain points.) -->

                        <b>The Goal</b>
                        Design an easy-to-use app that uses AI to simplify trip planning by generating trip ideas and itineraries based on user input.
                        The app should also support social features like group trip planning and cost-sharing, helping users travel more affordably
                        and collaboratively.

                    <b>User Research</b>
                    To understand user frusturations, needs, and requirements, I conducted informal interviews and secondary research 
                    to understand how people, especially students and young professionals plan trips. Key patterns emerged around
                    budget constraints, analysis paralysis, lack of time, and wanting to travel with others but struggling to 
                    organize group trips.

                    For this user research, I chose interviews in order to have a deep undertanding of the users pain points.

                    <b>Paper Wireframes</b>
                    I began by sketching paper wireframes on my tablet, focusing on the core features identified
                    during user research. For each screen, I explored three different layout ideas. From these, I selected my favorite elements to create a consolidated final draft.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                <article id="main" class="container special">

                    I then used Figma to translate my sketches into low-fidelity wireframes. After several iterations,
                    these screens best represented the user flow and addressed the key needs uncovered in research. 
                    From the finalized wireframes, I built a low-fidelity prototype to test functionality‚Äîprioritizing intuitive flow,
                        accessibility, and usability‚Äîbefore moving on to the final design.

                    <li><b>Finding:</b> Users struggled to narrow down trips and friend groups because filter options were too broad.</li>
                    <li><b>Iteration:</b> Add more detailed filters‚Äîsuch as budget sliders, preferred activities (e.g., hiking, culinary), group size, and traveler age ranges. Implement multi-select checkboxes and real-time filter counts so users immediately see how many results match their criteria.</li>

                    <li><b>Iteration:</b> Redesign the groups list with clear labels and icons for key attributes: group size, average budget per person, trip type, and member interests.

                <b>Sticker Sheet</b> I created a sticker sheet to streamline my design process by using reusable assets.

                    <li><b> Embracing the Design Process from Paper to Prototype</b> 
                        Starting with simple paper sketches helped me stay grounded in user needs before jumping into digital tools. 
                        It taught me the value of iterating slowly and building each screen with purpose and clarity.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Overcoming Challenges with Figma & Functionality</b> 
                        Learning to make the app functional in Figma was both rewarding and challenging. 
                        I iterated several times to ensure smooth user flows, and each step helped me better 
                        understand how structure, interaction, and accessibility all play a role in great design.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Growing from User Feedback</b> 
                        Conducting usability interviews was a major growth moment. 
                        I learned to separate my personal feelings from design critiques, using feedback as a powerful tool
                         to improve the user experience. It reminded me that good design is about solving problems, 
                         not defending decisions.
