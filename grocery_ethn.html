						<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
						<!-- <br> -->
						</p>
					    This project aims to understand the ways in which young people do grocery shopping - delivery or pick up or offline - the traditional way. In this project, we hope to bring an ethnographic eye to what has become a regular and somewhat mundane activity to most adults, but one which has a variety of ritualistic practices and information systems integrated into it. We are particular interested in young adults because as more tech-savvy individuals they are likely to approach grocery shopping in a number of different ways.

						<p><h1>PHASE 1 - UNDERSTAND</h1>
						<b>Target Audience</b>
						Grocery shopping is a familiar topic for most people, yet it's not something we always reflect on deeply.
						For early adults aged 18-34, this area offers rich insights into user behavior. Key questions include how
						individuals plan and search for items online, their trust in star ratings and other indicators of credibility,
						their methods for finding discounts, and their habits around leaving reviews and managing digital receipts. 
						Investigating these aspects can reveal valuable trends and patterns in both offline and online grocery shopping, 
						particularly in terms of platform preferences and shopping behaviors among young people.
						
						<br>
						<b>Key Literature Review</b>
						Consumer behavior typically involves five core stages: problem recognition, search, alternative evaluation, purchase, 
						and outcomes. In the context of online grocery shopping, pricing strategies in apps and websites provide increased data 
						availability and flexibility for consumers. This trend is growing globally as online grocery shopping becomes a preferred
						 option for those with constraints such as time, transportation, or cost. However, contrary to some studies, one paper 
						 noted that online sources were infrequently mentioned as influences on everyday in-store information behavior, even among 
						 college students, challenging the findings of other research in this area.
						<br>
						<b>Interviews</b> Interviews with all participants were conducted at a grocery store of their choice. 
						The interview process included questions prepared for before shopping, during shopping, and after shopping.
						 With the participants' permission, their responses were recorded. During the interviews, participants carried out their 
						 grocery shopping while the interviewer followed and asked questions. 
						The post-activity interview focused on gathering information about their overall experiences and collecting demographic details.

						</p>
						
						<br>
						<p><h1>PHASE 2 - ANALYSIS</h1></p>
						We utilized Miro, a digital collaboration platform, to upload and analyze our raw data. Each team member contributed their 
						observations, photos, and comments from the interviews. We employed affinity mapping, a UX research clustering method, to 
						organize and make sense of the insights, feedback, and design issues identified by the participants. This approach allowed 
						us to systematically analyze the data and extract meaningful patterns and conclusions.
						
						<br>
						<br>

						<p><h1>PHASE 3 - RECOMMENDATIONS </h1></p>
						As a team, we identified key pain points through affinity mapping and then engaged in unrestricted brainstorming to devise solutions
						 for the challenges participants encountered. Using the laddering method, we designed recommendations based on our observations, 
						 pinpointing the root causes of these pain points and proposing actionable solutions. This process allowed us to develop both long-term 
						 and short-term recommendations aimed at enhancing the grocery shopping experience. Our suggestions were crafted to address specific 
						 issues identified during our research, with a focus on practical implementation for improving overall user satisfaction.
