							<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
						</header>

						<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
						<p>

						This project <b>explores how young adults (18-34) navigate grocery shopping</b>—whether through in-store visits,
						 pickup, or delivery. By applying an <b>ethnographic lens</b>, we uncovered behavioral patterns, decision-making
						  processes, and digital tool usage that influence their shopping experience. Given their tech-savviness, 
						  young adults often approach grocery shopping in diverse and evolving ways, making them a key demographic 
						  for understanding future trends in grocery retail.
					    <!-- This project aims to <b>understand the ways in which young people do grocery shopping</b> - delivery 
						or pick up or offline - the traditional way. In this project, we hope to bring an <b>ethnographic eye</b> 
						to what has become a regular and somewhat mundane activity to most adults, but one which has a 
						variety of ritualistic practices and information systems integrated into it. 
						We are particular interested in young adults because as more tech-savvy individuals they are 
						likely to approach grocery shopping in a number of different ways. 
						 -->
						<!-- Young adults (18-34) engage with grocery shopping across in-store, pickup, and online channels,
						yet their behaviors and decision-making processes remain largely unexplored. This study examined
						how they search for items, trust ratings, find discounts, leave reviews, and manage digital receipts,
						 uncovering key trends in platform preferences and shopping habits. -->

						<h3>PHASE 1 - UNDERSTAND</h3>
						<b>Background Research</b>
						Grocery shopping follows five key stages—problem recognition, search, evaluation, purchase, and outcomes. 
						While online platforms offer pricing flexibility and convenience, <b>our research explored how young adults balance digital 
						and in-store decision-making</b>. Interestingly, despite the rise of e-commerce, we found that online sources had minimal 
						influence on in-store shopping behavior, challenging assumptions about digital adoption
						<br>
						<br>

						<!-- <b>Participants</b>
						Young adults (18-34) engage with grocery shopping across in-store, pickup, and online channels, yet their behaviors 
						and decision-making processes remain largely unexplored. This study examined how they search for items, trust ratings, 
						find discounts, leave reviews, and manage digital receipts, uncovering key trends in platform preferences and shopping habits. -->
						<!-- Grocery shopping is a familiar topic for most people, yet it's not something we always reflect on deeply.
						For early adults aged 18-34, this area offers rich insights into user behavior. Key questions include how
						individuals plan and search for items online, their trust in star ratings and other indicators of credibility,
						their methods for finding discounts, and their habits around leaving reviews and managing digital receipts. 
						Investigating these aspects can reveal valuable trends and patterns in both offline and online grocery shopping, 
						particularly in terms of platform preferences and shopping behaviors among young people. -->

						<!-- Consumer behavior typically involves five core stages: problem recognition, search, alternative evaluation, purchase, 
						and outcomes. In the context of online grocery shopping, pricing strategies in apps and websites provide increased data 
						availability and flexibility for consumers. This trend is growing globally as online grocery shopping becomes a preferred
						 option for those with constraints such as time, transportation, or cost. However, contrary to some studies, one paper 
						 noted that online sources were infrequently mentioned as influences on everyday in-store information behavior, even among 
						 college students, challenging the findings of other research in this area. -->
					

						<b>Interviews</b> Interviews with all participants were conducted at a grocery store of their choice. 
						The interview process included questions prepared for before shopping, during shopping, and after shopping.
						With consent, we recorded participant responses for analysis. During the interviews, participants carried out their 
						 grocery shopping while the interviewer followed and asked questions. 
						 A post-shopping interview captured their overall experience and demographic details
						</p>

						<p><h3>PHASE 2 - ANALYSIS</h3></p>
						We used Miro to centralize and analyze our raw data, incorporating observations, photos, and interview notes from all team members. 
						To uncover key themes, we conducted <b>three iterations of affinity mapping</b>, that allowed us to identify patterns by clustering related insights.
						This iterative approach allowed us to refine our understanding, ensuring that emerging themes were robust and representative of user experiences.
						This approach was crucial in distilling complex qualitative data into clear pain points and behavioral trends, enabling us to derive 
						actionable insights that directly informed our design recommendations.
						<!-- We employed affinity mapping, a UX research clustering method, to 
						organize and make sense of the insights, feedback, and design issues identified by the participants. This approach allowed 
						us to systematically analyze the data and extract meaningful patterns and conclusions.

							</center>
								
							After synthesizing insights from our affinity mapping, we identified key pain points and engaged in an
							unrestricted brainstorming session to explore potential solutions. We initially explored metaphor extremes, and contrasts for ideation, but found these methods misaligned with our research goals.
							 Instead, we adopted the <b>laddering method</b>, which provided
							a more structured framework for connecting observed behaviors to underlying user needs. 
							This method helped us develop targeted, <b>actionable design recommendations grounded in our research
							findings</b>.
								
						<!-- We derived the main groups from the affinity mapping and brainstormed without limits to come up with 
						main painponts which then we 
						used the laddering method that allowed us to make design reccomendations based on observations. 
						We tried to use metaphors, extremes and contrasts to help us derive design recommendations. 
						This did not seem like an appropriate method for this problem so we are shelving this and not 
						using the results further. We found that laddering offered us a better framework for us. -->

						<p><h3>PHASE 3 - Recommendations </h3></p>
						 <!-- As a team, we identified key pain points through affinity mapping and then engaged in unrestricted brainstorming to devise solutions
						 for the challenges participants encountered. Using the laddering method, we designed recommendations based on our observations, 
						 pinpointing the root causes of these pain points and proposing actionable solutions.  -->
						 We developed both <b>long-term and short-term recommendations</b> aimed at enhancing the grocery shopping
						 experience. Our suggestions were crafted to address specific issues identified during our research,
						 with a focus on practical implementation for improving overall user satisfaction.

							<p><h3>Reflections & Takeaways </h3></p>

							This project gave me the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse team, each member bringing unique perspectives. 
							I learned the importance of active listening, open-mindedness, and trust in collaborative environments
							<br>
							<br>
							<li><b>Talking to Users:</b> Conducting ethnographic research taught me the value of patience and deep observation. 
								Truly listening—creating a safe space for users to express their thoughts and walk through their processes—was essential in uncovering meaningful insights.
							</li>

							<li><b>Selecting the Right Methods:</b> Choosing the appropriate research method is critical, especially when working within project timelines. 
								This experience reinforced the importance of having a strong methodological foundation to make informed decisions.
							</li>
							<li><b>Time Management & Teamwork:</b> Working with a diverse team helped me appreciate different work styles and communication approaches. 
								Understanding and adapting to these differences improved collaboration and efficiency. </li>
