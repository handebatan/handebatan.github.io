							<h3>The Polyvocality of Online COVID-19 Vaccine Narratives that
								Invoke Medical Racism</h3>
				
						</header>
						<p>
							<b>Introduction: </b> In June 2020 in Denver, Colorado, the Black Lives Matter protests were taking place and nearby was a different group of
							protests happing, the anti-vaccine activist. At one point, the anti-vaccine activist yelled to the Black Lives Matters marchers to remember 
							Tuskegee and to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine. “Remember Tuskegee” refers to the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment that took place in 1930’s.
							Our study examines the discourse on Twitter where conversations about the Tuskegee Study and COVID-19 vaccinations intersect and aims to understand:
							
							<ol>
								<li>How those who are concerned about medical racism speak about vaccine compliance concerns in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. </li>
								<li>Whether disinformation activity that exploits medical racism is happening. </li>
								<li>To what extent spaces that are traditionally the province of Black Twitter are infiltrated by people with intent to disrupt.</li>
							  </ol>
							This research explores the disinformation ecosystem surrounding conversations about medical racism and COVID-19 vaccines, particularly focusing on right-wing actors targeting Black-presenting profiles and invoking the Tuskegee experiments. 
						
						<br>
						<br>

						<b>Research Methods: </b> We extracted data from Twitter between the dates February 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021, that was either a tweet, retweet, or a quote tweet
							on the term “tuskegee” (including misspellings: tuskagee,” “tuskeegee,” or “tuskeygee.), which next, we searched the tweets with the term, “vax” or “vacc”.
							After further empirical inspections, we narrowed the data to 538 accounts with 3000 tweets, each of which was analyzed using qualitative inductive thematic
							analysis of vaccine discourse and speaker personas, and to build network graphs to visualize the interactions of the voices. The network graphs contained 
							all the tweets posted by the 538 accounts (even tweets that did not include Tuskegee and vaccine search terms), that resulted in 19 million tweets representing 
							a wide range of monologues within this discourse. 
						
							<br>
						</p>

						
						<br>
						<p><b>Findings: </b> We discovered a polyvocal space, meaning a mix of voices, positions, and agendas, discussing the relationship between medical racism and vaccine compliance. We did not use preset categories or identity features; instead, the accounts' publicized religious, political, and racial identities led to the emergence of 12 distinct voices. The paper provides in-depth qualitative descriptions of the 12 voices and what the conversation looked like before and during the pandemic in the paper.</p>

						<p>During the peri-pandemic period (after February 1, 2020), we see the production of more anti-vaccine content that targets communities of color and is subsequently shared through various networks. The Black-presenting, pro-vaccine accounts increase in presence and volume as they carry the burden of debunking this information coming from voices on all sides. When we focus on vaccine distrustful interactions, we see that the largely distinct vaccine distrust superclusters had little interaction prior to the pandemic. Yet the number of interactions grew significantly—up 84% during the pandemic.</p>
						
						<p>Through this longitudinal and comparative investigation, we find a polyvocal space consisting of users who share messages with different underlying values, those who share the same underlying values but spread different messages, and those whose purpose is to confuse the space with rhetoric that falls along social or political party lines. The truth of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study is so offensive that it takes a moment to explain that parts of it are hijacked or exploited to tell untruths that cause further harm. We discussed disinformation as a foreground background trick.</p>

						<b>Conclusion: </b>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Foreground-Background Disinformation:</strong> Disinformation often presents a misleading foreground issue while obscuring the true agenda in the background, requiring readers to detect underlying motives across multiple voices.</li>
							<li><strong>Exploitation of Medical Racism:</strong> Anti-vaccine activists co-opt legitimate concerns about medical racism, such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, to push a political agenda that denies the value of vaccines.</li>
							<li><strong>Role of Platforms:</strong> Twitter serves as a proxy for validity, automatically lending credibility to any account created on the platform, which raises concerns about who should bear the responsibility for design frictions.</li>
							<li><strong>Combatting Disinformation:</strong> Addressing disinformation requires human and machine-driven methods, as well as tools, visualizations, and policies that enhance the human experience while acknowledging the diverse voices in emergent discussions.</li>
